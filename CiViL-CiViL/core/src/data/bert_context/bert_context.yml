  \ of olive oil, do you have the ingredients? You are ready to start. Firstly, cut\
  \ off the excess fat from the 2 pounds of chicken breasts, cut off the tenderloins\
  \ and cut them into nugget sizes, about 1-2 inches. Next, you must dissolve \xBD\
  \ cup of salt and \xBD cup of sugar in 1 quart of cold water in a gallon-size ZipLock\
  \ plastic bag, got it? Add the cutlets and seal the bag, make sure to press out\
  \ as much air as possible, then place the bag in a bowl or dish and let it refrigerate\
  \ for 30 minutes. Now, line some rimmed baking sheets with triple layers of paper\
  \ towels, then remove the chicken from the bag and lay it in a single layer of baking\
  \ sheet. Next, cover with another triple layer of paper towels and press down firmly\
  \ on each nugget so that they are all about the same thickness, allowing them to\
  \ dry for about 10 minutes. Now, carefully peel the paper towels off the cutlets,\
  \ then sprinkle them with 2 tsp of black pepper and set them aside. Spread 1 cup\
  \ of all-purpose flour in a baking dish, then beat 2 large eggs with 1 tbsp of oil\
  \ in a second baking dish. Process 8 slices of high quality white bread in a food\
  \ processor until evenly fine-textured for about 20-30 seconds. Now, transfer the\
  \ crumbs to the baking dish and add a dash of salt and pepper to the breadcrumbs\
  \ and stir to combine. Now take two or three nuggets at a time and cover them in\
  \ flour, shaking off any excess, using tongs, dip in both sides of the nuggets in\
  \ the egg mixture to generously coat. Next, place them in a bowl with the breadcrumbs\
  \ and press down on them to fully and evenly coat each nugget. Place the nuggets\
  \ in a single layer on a wire rack over a baking sheet, then you must repeat the\
  \ previous step with the remaining nuggets and allow them to stand for 5 minutes\
  \ to let the breadcrumbs coat dry. Heat up 6 tbsp of oil in a heavy-bottomed 12-inch\
  \ nonstick skillet over a medium-high heat until it shimmers but not smoking, do\
  \ this for 2 minutes. Now place as many nuggets as will fit on the skillet but allow\
  \ some space between the nuggets to ensure even cooking and gently press down on\
  \ each nugget with a spatula to help ensure even browning. Cook them until they\
  \ are deep golden brown and crisp on the first side, for about 2 and \xBD minutes,\
  \ using tongs, flip the nuggets and reduce the heat to medium. Line up the warmed\
  \ plate with the double layer of paper towels and set the cutlets on top, then return\
  \ the plate to the oven. Next, discard the oil in a skillet and make sure to wipe\
  \ down the skillet clean using tongs and a large wad of paper towels. Now, repeat\
  \ using fresh oil and now-clean the skillet to cook the remaining nuggets, make\
  \ sure to do this until the nuggets are cooked. Serve with ketchup and desired condiments."

r184: First, preheat an oven to 180c or Gas mark 4 and place 2 large aubergines over
  the open flame to burn the skins. When the skins are scalded all over, place the
  aubergines on a baking tray and cook in an oven for 35-40 minutes and remove and
  leave to cool when cooked.. If the aubergines are cool, cut them down the middle
  using a kitchen knife and scoop out the creamy flesh with a spoon. Be sure to remove
  any black toasted skin from the pulp. Using a sharp kitchen knife, chop the aubergines
  until they form a rough puree. Transfer the puree to a large bowl and leave to drain
  in the fridge overnight. In a dry frying pan, toast 2 tablespoons of cumin seeds
  and 2 tablespoons of coriander seeds on low heat 180c / Gas mark 4 for 8-10 minutes.

  of the toasted spice powder and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the drained aubergine
  and when hot add 100ml of double cream and the zest of one lemon and the juice of
  two, and season with salt and pepper. Mix the ingredients together and set aside.
  Sprinkle the remaining spice mixture over 200g/7oz of skinned monkfish fillets and
  cook in a non stick frying pan on a medium heat for 6-8 minutes. Regularly turn
  to fillets to prevent the spices from burning and tainting the fish. Remove the
  fillets from the pan and baste with melted butter and a squeeze of lemon juice and
  set aside to rest. Next make the dressing by finely chopping 100g of green pitted
  green olives, 1 red chili and 1 tablespoons of drained capers and add to a large
  bowl. Finely chop half a bunch of flat leaf parsley with a kitchen knife and drizzle
  over with olive oil and the remaining lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.
